1 > how to install django and file structure

install uv

uv venv

.venv\Scripts\activate

uv pip install Django

django-admin startproject "name"  -- you only use startproject once

python manage.py runserver - to run the project
python manage.py runserver "8001" - to run on any different port


2 > templates and errors in django 

flow of django

request comes to the django
then it goes to the url resolver - most of the time we dont have access to it (99%)
then it goes to urls.py - where it will decide which route to go to - /admin , /login etc
then it goes to views.py - these are basically controllers (the same you studied in node)
it can fetch from DB if needed
then it sends the response to the django which further on send the request


templates - here comes the html files

static - here comes the tailwind and js files

add templates in setting.py in dirs for rendering

templating engine 

path should be accessable - go in settings.py and change STATIC_URL


3 > Jinja2 and apps

run python manage.py startapp 'name' to create the folder for an app

your main project doesnt know that there are new app
so you should make the main project aware that there are new apps

therefore go to settings

go to installed_apps and add your app name

so there are two types of urls
one of the main project and others of the app
therefore to go from main project to the app urls 
use 'include' in urls.py of main project
