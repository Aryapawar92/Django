2 > templates and errors in django 

flow of django

request comes to the django
then it goes to the url resolver - most of the time we dont have access to it (99%)
then it goes to urls.py - where it will decide which route to go to - /admin , /login etc
then it goes to views.py - these are basically controllers (the same you studied in node)
it can fetch from DB if needed
then it sends the response to the django which further on send the request


templates - here comes the html files

static - here comes the tailwind and js files

add templates in setting.py in dirs for rendering

templating engine 

path should be accessable - go in settings.py and change STATIC_URL
